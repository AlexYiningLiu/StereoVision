# StereoVision
First-principles implementation of stereo depth construction. 3D-vision is achieved using 2D camera images.

Project includes both a Python and an MATLAB version, both produces a real-world 3D point cloud that corresponds to the scene depicted in the 2 given stereo images. 

1. Block Matching method using Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) is implemented in both Python and MATLAB.
2. Integral Images method is implemented in Python.
